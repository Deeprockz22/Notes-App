```bash
# Install serve globally (one-time)
npm install -g serve

# Run server
serve
```

**C. Using VS Code:**
Install the "Live Server" extension, then right-click `index.html` > "Open with Live Server"

**Step 2: Open in Browser**
Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown)

**Step 3: Install the App**
- **Desktop (Chrome/Edge):** Click the install icon in the address bar OR click "📱 Install App" button
- **Android:** Tap menu (⋮) > "Install app" or "Add to Home screen"

- ✅ Private (never sent to servers)
- ⚠️ Browser-specific (not synced across devices)
- ⚠️ Clearing browser data will delete all content

---

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Storage:** LocalStorage API

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Install button doesn't appear:**
- Make sure you're accessing via `http://localhost` or `https://`
- The `file://` protocol doesn't support PWA installation
- Try a different browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)

**Service worker won't register:**
- PWA features require HTTPS or localhost
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear cache and reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Data disappeared:**
- Check if browser data/cache was cleared
- LocalStorage is browser-specific
- Try checking in the original browser
